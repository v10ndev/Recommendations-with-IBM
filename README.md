# Recommendations-with-IBM

## Project Overview
I learned and practiced the basics of recommendation systems through the tasks in Jupyter notebook [Recommendations_with_IBM Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/DSND_Term2/tree/master/project_files/Recommendations_with_IBM)
And the goal of the project is to make recommendations to user about new articles we think they will like.
